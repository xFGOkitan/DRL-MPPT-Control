# DRL MPPT Control
 Hello, this is my first major project using Deep Reinforcement Learning for MPPT Control in a solar panel system.
This project is part of my final university coursework, where I am exploring the use of DRL for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in solar panels. I chose this approach because of AIâ€™s growing potential and its promising applications in optimizing energy efficiency, as seen in various research studies.

Currently, I am fine-tuning the reward system to ensure stricter reinforcement, as well as troubleshooting an issue with one of the final output graphs not displaying correctly.
